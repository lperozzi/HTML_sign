# Responsive HTML mail signatures
### Let's punch email clients in the stomach!
Responsive templates for mail signatures. <br/>

When you need some basic signatures that work on mobile.<br/>
...and your colleagues need them too.<br/>
...but you don't want to deal with tables and inline styles.

## Preview
Here's how the samples look:

## Other languages
[Read the docs in Korean!](/README_kor.md)

## Motivation
Let's make writing HTML emails & email signatures easier. We won't fix all email clients, but we can surely make the process of satisfying them a tad nicer. <br/>
See a fairly comprehensive rant on the subject (and not only) [in this article](http://fadeit.dk/blog/post/html-emails-and-email-signatures-how-hard-can-it-be).


## What does it do
- [x] config-based template generation
- [x] allows generating multiple templates (for your colleagues too!)
- [x] transforms linked (`<link>`) CSS into inline styles
- [x] embeds local `img[src]` into the template (base64).*
- [x] minifies the template
- [x] media queries for mail clients that support them
- [x] can build templates from multiple sources
- [x] watches HTML/CSS files for changes and re-builds


**Some mail clients don't support them, so an external URL might be a good idea.*


## Getting started
```
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Take a look at `src/fadeit/` for an example. Copy / Paste, rename it and change `src/fadeit/conf.js` to suite your needs. Run `gulp` to build the templates (into `/dist`). The gulp task will watch HTML & CSS files by default.

## Overview
This diagram shows what happens to your templates.

## CSS Support
Remember, it's HTML mails, so you need to check a big-ass table to find out nothing's gonna work.
See [this](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/). Still [gulp-inline-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-inline-css) is being used to convert whatever CSS you throw at it to inline styles.


## TODO:
- [ ] closing `inline-css` issue [#8](https://github.com/jonkemp/inline-css/issues/8#issuecomment-149025428) would greatly improve this repo
- [ ] preprocessor support (simplifies BEM)
- [ ] use github pages to show some live demos
- [ ] check [gulp-inline-css](https://github.com/jonkemp/inline-css) for new features
- [ ] organize examples better
- [ ] upgrade deps (could use [gulp-david](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-david) or similar)


## Usage with different e-mail clients

### Thunderbird
There are several Thunderbird plugins which can automatically insert signatures when composing e-mails. We recommend [SmartTemplate4](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/smarttemplate4) as one of the options. It can use different templates for new e-mails, replies and forwarded e-mails.


### Apple Mail / OS X (oh boy)

#### Solution 1
- Open Mail.app and go to `Mail` -> `Preferences` -> `Signatures`
- Create a new signature and write some placeholder text (doesn't matter what it is, but you have to identify it later).
- Close Mail.app.
- Open terminal, then open the signature files using TextEdit (might be different for iCloud drive check the article below).
```
$ open -a TextEdit ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/V3/MailData/Signatures/ubiquitous_*.mailsignature
```
- Keep the file with the placeholder open, close the other ones.
- Replace the `<body>...</body>` and it's contents with the template of your choice. *Don't remove the meta information at the top!*
- Open Mail.app and compose a new mail. Select the signature from the list to test it out.

**NB**: Images won't appear in the signature preview, but will work fine when you compose a message.


####Solution 2
You can also open the HTML files in `/dist` in a browser, CMD + A, CMD + C and then paste into the signature box. This won't copy the `<html>` part or the `<style>` part that includes media queries. Follow the guide if you want it.


#### Troubleshooting

If solution #1 doesn't work, you can repeat the steps and lock the signature files before you open Mail.app again.
Lock Files:
```
$ chflags uchg ~/Library/Mail/V3/MailData/Signatures/*.mailsignature
```

If you want to do changes later, you have to unlock the files:
```
$ chflags nouchg ~/Library/Mail/V3/MailData/Signatures/*.mailsignature
```

If you are using iCloud drive or having problems with it, you might also want to check [this article](http://matt.coneybeare.me/how-to-make-an-html-signature-in-apple-mail-for-el-capitan-os-x-10-dot-11/).

### Outlook 2010 Client for Windows 7

#### Solution 1 
- Open Outlook 2010 and go to `File > Option > Mail > Signature` 
- Create new signature (with a placeholder for your convenience)
- Open signature folder using CMD

> As the AppData folder is hidden, I'd recommend you to opne it via CMD.

```
cd AppData\Roamin\Microsoft
start Signatures 
```

- Within this folder, find a file named with your placeholder then right click this file and select edit.
- Replace it with your HTML and save
- Open Outlook again and check your signature

#### Solution 2
Unfortnately, Outlook 2010 client dosen't support HTML file import features for your email template. But you can add your own signatures by simple Copy and paste like **Solution 2** above. 

- Open built html file on `/dist` folder and Ctrl A + C 
- Open Outlook 2010 and go to `File > Option > Mail > Signature` 
- Create new signature and paste copyed one

> **NB**: base 64 will not be shown on Outlook 2010 client. So, I recommend to use external url if you want to use images.
